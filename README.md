# NetEmulation #

NetEmulation is a freely available simulation package for computer interconnect networks focusing on optical technologies. Unlike other network simulators, NetEmulation is written in SystemVerilog which, although slow for simulation, allows modules to be synthesised to obtain speed/area/power estimates for the control plane and also can form the basis of FPGA-based network demonstrators.

Each folder contains a README.md file.  This is a file written in the markdown format that describes the contents of the folder.  This file should be maintained at the same time as the code so that discrepancies do not occur.  For more information consult the [wiki](https://github.com/DannyNicholls/NetEmulation/wiki)

>**DESCRIPTION :** Copy of the code taken from collab.ee.ucl.ac.uk on 08/10/2013  
**NOTES :** Appears to have duplicate files.  Will store this folder here until new file structure is in place and needed files have been copied into the new location.  No standard code.  Before taking code from this folder it should be edited to a standard format.
